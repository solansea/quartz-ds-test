#### Область Компетенции (Area of Expertise)

Choose one skill you already have from the crafting skill group. Whenever you obtain a tier 1 outcome on an easy or medium test using this skill, you treat it as a tier 2 outcome instead. Additionally, if you spend 1 minute inspecting an object related to the chosen skill, you can estimate its value and learn of any flaws in its construction.


#### Эксперт-Ремесленник (Expert Artisan)

Whenever you make a test as part of a crafting or research project that uses a skill you already have from the crafting skill group, you can make the power roll twice and use either roll.


#### Рукастый (Handy)

Whenever you make a test to craft something and don't have a skill that applies to the test, you gain a +1 bonus to the power roll.


#### Импровизированное Создание (Improvisation Creation)

Without needing to make a test—and even without tools—you can quickly jury-rig or repair a mundane item or piece of equipment related to a skill you have from the crafting skill group. That item lasts for 1 hour or works for one use or activation (whichever comes first, as the Director determines), then breaks beyond repair. For example, if you have the Carpentry skill, you could repair a rickety wooden bridge long enough for a group of creatures to cross it, or build a simple shovel made of wood that can be used for 1 hour.


#### Вдохновлённый Ремесленник (Inspired Artisan)

When you make a project roll using a skill from the crafting skill group, you can spend a hero token to make another project roll for the same project as part of the same respite activity. You can't use this perk more than once per respite.


#### Путешествующий Ремесленник (Traveling Artisan)

On any day when you don't take a respite, you can spend 1 uninterrupted hour working on a crafting project using a skill you have from the crafting skill group. If you do so, you gain 1d10 project points toward that project.

> The existence of specific perks doesn't mean that a hero can't attempt the task related to a perk without having that perk. Aside from supernatural perks, a Director can always allow a hero to attempt a mundane task mentioned in a perk by making a test. Perks are special because they allow a hero to attempt a specific task without a test, and often give a better result than a successful test—or even a test with a reward would give.
>
> For example, can a hero catch a falling ally if they don't have the I've Got You perk? A Director can absolutely allow it, but might decide that the hero needs to succeed on a Might test to accomplish the task, using a main action or maneuver to prepare for it. Being able to catch an ally automatically as a free triggered action is what the perk gets you!
