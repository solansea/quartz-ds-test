Each such creature who is not hostile toward you listens to what you have to say for 1 uninterrupted minute or more, or until they sense danger or any form of imminent harm. While creatures are listening to you, each of your allies gains an edge on tests made to avoid being noticed by those creatures.\nГармонизатор (Harmonizer)\nYou can make a Presence test using the Music skill to influence creatures who don’t have emotions or can’t understand you.

If they choose not to answer honestly, they simply deflect or redirect the question, with no further complications. If they choose to answer honestly, the creature can immediately ask you a question about yourself in turn, which you must answer honestly.\nПростите Моего Друга (Pardon My Friend)\nWhen an ally within 5 squares fails a Presence test, you can step in and make a Presence test that takes a bane, with your roll replacing the ally’s roll.

That item lasts for 1 hour or works for one use or activation (whichever comes first, as the Director determines), then breaks beyond repair.

Aside from supernatural perks, a Director can always allow a hero to attempt a mundane task mentioned in a perk by making a test. Perks are special because they allow a hero to attempt a specific task without a test, and often give a better result than a successful test—or even a test with a reward would give.\nFor example, can a hero catch a falling ally if they don’t have the I’ve Got You perk? A Director can absolutely allow it, but might decide that the hero needs to succeed on a Might test to accomplish the task, using a main action or maneuver to prepare for it. Being able to catch an ally automatically as a free triggered action is what the perk gets you!\n"},"Бонусы-(Perks)/Сверхъестественные-бонусы-(Supernatural-Perks)":{"slug":"Бонусы-(Perks)/Сверхъестественные-бонусы-(Supernatural-Perks)","filePath":"Бонусы (Perks)/Сверхъестественные бонусы (Supernatural Perks).md","title":"Сверхъестественные бонусы (Supernatural Perks)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Таинственный Трюк (Arcane Trick)\nYou have the following ability.\nArcane Trick\nYou cast an entertaining spell that creates a minor but impressive magical effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagicMain action📏 Self; see below🎯 Self\nEffect: Choose one of the following effects:\n\nYou teleport a size 1S or smaller object adjacent to you into an unoccupied space adjacent to you.\nUntil the start of your next turn, a part of your body shoots a shower of harmless noisy sparks that light up each square adjacent to you.\nYou ignite or snuff out (your choice) every mundane light source of 1L or smaller adjacent to you.\nYou transform up to 1 pound of edible food you touch to make it taste delicious or disgusting.\nUntil the start of your next turn, you make your body exude a particular odor you’ve smelled before.

On a tier 3 outcome, you can instead gain knowledge that would be uncommon among criminals as long as such information exists—the location of a local treasure cache, the location of a murder weapon used in a noble’s assassination, the name of an NPC secretly bankrolling a local assassin’s guild, and so forth.\nНезапоминающееся Лицо (Forgettable Face)\nIf you spend 10 minutes or less interacting with a creature who hasn’t met you before, you can cause them to forget your face when you part.

The Director can decide that certain lore can’t be revealed this way.\nЭйдетическая Память (Eidetic Memory)\nYour mind is an encyclopedia, though not always an easy one to organize. When you finish a respite, choose one skill from the lore skill group that you don’t have. You have that skill until you finish your next respite.

Although you escaped with your life, the mission was a public failure thanks to bad information your agency gave you. They denied you work for them, and you went on the run. Hero work will let you survive and clear your name.2Faceless: Your identity was always hidden. It was your way of protecting those around you because the work you did spying on powerful entities came with dangers. Then your world came crashing down when an enemy agent unmasked you, causing you to lose everything—your privacy, livelihood, loved ones, all gone in the blink of an eye. Instead of going into hiding, you became a public hero to protect the innocent in the name of those you lost.3Free Agent: There was a time in your life when you used to sell information to the highest bidder. Your acts were unsanctioned by any one organization, but you were well-connected enough to trade in secrets. Politics never mattered much to you until the information you sold wound up causing a ripple effect of harm that eventually destroyed the place you once called home. You became a hero to make up for your past.4Informed: After years of cultivating a rich list of informants, one of those informants risked everything to expose the heinous plans of powerful individuals. You promised to protect your informant, but your agency left them hanging—literally. You cut ties with your employer and swore to always make good on your word as a hero.5Spies and Lovers: While embedded in an undercover assignment, you fell for someone on the other side. They discovered you were a double agent, and though you insisted your feelings were real, the deceit cut too deep for your love interest to ignore. They exposed you, spurned you, or died because of their closeness to you. You left the espionage business to become a hero with nothing to hide.6Turncoat: You spent your life in service of your country or an organization that upheld your values. During your undercover operations, you discovered that everything you had been told was a lie. Whether you confronted your superiors or were exposed, you were stripped of your service medals before you left to become a true hero."},"Карьера-(Careers)/Адепт-(Disciple)":{"slug":"Карьера-(Careers)/Адепт-(Disciple)","filePath":"Карьера (Careers)/Адепт (Disciple).md","title":"Адепт (Disciple)","links":["Бонусы-(Perks)/Сверхъестественные-бонусы-(Supernatural-Perks)"],"tags":[],"content":"Вы служили в церкви, храме или ином религиозном институте как часть духовенства.

They convinced you to stop your cult’s plots. Now you follow in the footsteps of the angel who showed you the righteous path.2Dogma: Although you joined your religious institution under the guidance of a kind mentor, others within the house of worship became increasingly fanatical in their convictions. Your mentor sought to be a voice of reason in the rising tide of hatred and was tried as a heretic before being executed. Leaving the institution behind, you became a hero to uphold the beliefs you hold dear.3Freedom to Worship: Your temple was destroyed in a religious conflict. The institution’s leaders sought retaliation, but you saw in these actions a ceaseless cycle of destruction that would lead to more conflict. Instead, you became a hero to protect religious freedoms, so all worshippers might practice their faith without fear.4Lost Faith: You devoted your life to ministering to the sick and needy, alongside other charitable work. Time and time again, tragedy struck those you served without rhyme or reason. Your prayers went unanswered, and your efforts went thankless. Eventually, you lost your faith in a higher power, and you left your church or temple to do good outside of any religious affiliation.5Near-Death Experience: While serving at a religious institution, you almost died in an accident. When you woke, you had lost all memory of ever having worked for the church or temple. Though the clergy encouraged you to stay, you left to forge a new path. Your sense of altruism—whether instilled in you by your past work or a part of who you naturally are—guides you in your life.6Taxing Times: The faith-based organization you were once part of became corrupt. It used its status in the community to accumulate wealth through tithes, while its leaders sought political appointments. During a season of drought, the institution stockpiled resources and refused to give aid, resulting in the deaths of many.

Whether you shed light on the secret or not, you left to become a hero stripped of noble title.2Charmed Life: Whether through some supernatural power or your innate persuasiveness, you were able to defraud other aristocrats. You did it for fun. And when you were found out, you lost your status. Whether you served time or escaped punishment, you decided to rehabilitate yourself and became a hero.3Inheritance: The guardians who instilled in you the virtues of doing the right thing were murdered in a senseless petty robbery. Though their wealth was bequeathed to you, it did little to assuage the guilt you felt for being unable to stop the deadly crime. You decided to use your riches to fund your life as a hero, whether publicly or using an alter ego.4Privileged Position: Life outside the manor never piqued your interest. You had everything you wanted. It thus came as a surprise when the peasants came to overthrow your family. You narrowly escaped, and for the first time witnessed the world. It caused you to become a hero for the people, fighting against inequities.5Royal Pauper: Seeking a break from noble duties, you sought a lookalike to switch identities with. It went so well that you made a habit of switching whenever you were bored. Unfortunately, your counterpart became so good at imitating you that they convinced all those around you that you were an impostor. You lost contact with your family, but now pursue a heroic path free of the pomp of your old life.6Wicked Secret: One parent passed away when you were a baby and the other remarried years later. Then that parent died under suspicious circumstances. Their spouse ousted you, and you were banished (and possibly hunted).

You upheld your end of the deal—which made the knife in your back after the bout so surprising. You woke in a shallow grave, barely alive, and ready to mete out justice.2Heckler: As you stood victorious on the arena sands, a voice cried out among the cheering. “This violence is only for show. You should be ashamed. There are people who need you—who need your skills!” Why did that voice ring so clear? And why did it sound so familiar? You never saw the face of the person who uttered those words, but they weighed heavy on you. The next day, you fled the arena to begin a hero’s life.3Joined the Arena: As a child, you loved gladiatorial matches, captivated by the fierce displays of bravery and bravado, never giving much thought to how the competitors ended up in the ring. Then your friend was wrongly accused of a crime and sentenced to compete. You went in their place. After viewing what life was like for those forced to fight, you survived your sentence and resolved to protect the unfairly condemned.4New Challenges: You earned every title you could. You beat every opponent willing to face you in the arena. Your final battle with your rival ended with you victorious—and still you were unsatisfied. Other, greater foes are out there. And you mean to find them.5Scion’s Compassion: You were born a noble, but the duplicitous and power-hungry nature of your family had you seeking your own fortune in the arena. You saw that competitors brought there by circumstance and not choice suffered. You gave all you could of your family money to those lessfortunate folk, and then set out to make a real difference in this cruel world.6Warriors’ Home: The orphanage you grew up in secretly supplied gladiators to the arena. Forced to fight against many childhood friends as an adult, you vowed to dismantle the arena and free other victims. You became a liberator, dedicated to ending the oppression of others until your dying breath."},"Карьера-(Careers)/Исполнитель-(Performer)":{"slug":"Карьера-(Careers)/Исполнитель-(Performer)","filePath":"Карьера (Careers)/Исполнитель (Performer).md","title":"Исполнитель (Performer)","links":["Бонусы-(Perks)/Межличностные-бонусы-(Interpersonal-Perks)"],"tags":[],"content":"Вы умеете петь, играть или танцевать достаточно хорошо, чтобы вам за это даже платили.

You aren’t sure what happened, but seeking an answer quickly led you to places where only heroes dare to go.2False Accolades: After a poor performance, you found a script to a wellwritten play left in your dressing room. The accompanying note asked that if you performed the play, you should give the author credit. But after a commanding performance, you claimed to be star and playwright both and the curse hidden on those pages activated. A small portion of your skin has begun to transform into undead flesh, and the only cure is to prove you have become selfless.3Fame and Fortune: You thought you were famous—then that hero came to your show. Suddenly, all eyes were on the dragon-slaying brute instead of on the stage where they belonged. The audience even gave them a standing ovation when they entered the room. All you got was polite applause. Fine. If people want a hero so much, then a hero you shall be.4Songs to the Dead: Your performances have always been tinged with a bit of melancholy. During a particularly soulful performance, spirits disturbed the living audience and sat in their chairs. They begged you to prevent their demise, providing no other details before disappearing. You set out to determine if you could help your most dedicated fans.5Speechless: A heckler’s mocking words left you utterly speechless during a performance, stinging your pride and stirring your arrogance. The incident strained your legendary voice, and you could speak only in soft whispers. The heckler was a fey trickster who stole your voice, promising to give it back after you accomplished real good in the world.6Tragic Lesson: When a producer who once shortchanged you shouted out on the street for you to stop a thief who had picked their pocket, your spite toward them inspired you to let the thief run right on by. But that decision led to tragedy when the thief later harmed someone you loved. From that moment on, you made it your responsibility to protect others."},"Карьера-(Careers)/Исследователь-(Explorer)":{"slug":"Карьера-(Careers)/Исследователь-(Explorer)","filePath":"Карьера (Careers)/Исследователь (Explorer).md","title":"Исследователь (Explorer)","links":["Бонусы-(Perks)/Исследовательские-бонусы-(Exploration-Perks)"],"tags":[],"content":"Вы отправлялись в неизведанные края и зарабатывали на жизнь как картограф, исследователь, искатель ресурсов или охотник за сокровищами.

You subsequently turned to the life of a hero to put an end to the dread you unleashed and keep other hidden dangers at bay.2Missing Piece: You made an important but dangerous discovery about a treasure or ancient ritual that could spell mass destruction. Then the unthinkable happened when an unscrupulous colleague, spy, or treasure hunter stole your research notes. You’re looking for the thief now, and anyone else who might use such discoveries for ill.3Nothing Belongs in a Museum: Exploring distant lands to collect valuable artifacts for cultural institutions was once your way of life. But when people died trying to reclaim one of the objects you took, you realized the truth. Your work was part of a larger problem of cultural theft, and the best place for these significant objects wasn’t in a museum but with the people who created them. Setting out to return what had been taken and to protect others from theft set you on the path to become a hero.4Unschooled: You delved into dungeons and far-off places by studying them in books. You were an explorer who never felt the need to experience the dangers your peers did. Then your theory about a lost world cost you your reputation, and gave you the impetus to go on adventures and stand up for those with different ideas.5Wanderlust: You saw yourself as an observer and operated within a code of conduct. You swore to never interfere with a group by exposing them to your technology, knowledge, or values. But when faced with a moral conundrum, you either broke your code or stood idly by—and suffered the consequences. During this incident, you lost your observation journal but became a hero who refuses to let evil stand unchecked.6Wind in Your Sails: As a seafaring explorer, you lived to chart unknown courses. Though travel on the high seas was fraught with danger, the destination was always rewarding in riches, knowledge, or some other meaningful benefit.

You left at the first opportunity and haven’t looked back since.2Deserter: It was in the middle of a pirate raid (whether you were part of it or targeted by it) that you realized you no longer yearned for a sailor’s life. You used the chaos of the moment to slip away unnoticed. You now work as a hero in an effort to either end the piracy of others or atone for your past deeds, but you fear the day your old crew finds you and punishes you for your desertion.3Forgotten: You awoke aboard your ship with no memory of who you were. Though the other sailors insisted they knew you, you didn’t know them. The next time you went ashore, you decided to stay, determined to find out who you really are.4Jealousy: You had the favor of your captain, which earned you many rivals aboard your ship. One night, your fellow sailors pulled you from your bunk and threw you overboard. By some miracle, you were scooped from the waters by a passing vessel. You worked off your debt to them, then set out on a new life involving less pettiness.5Marooned: There was a mutiny, and you were on the losing side. You were marooned on an island and escaped when a merchant vessel was blown off course by a storm and found you. Your reputation is ruined among sailors, so you seek adventure elsewhere.6Water Fear: A catastrophic storm hit while you were at sea, destroying your ship and leaving you as the only survivor. Once you recovered, you tried to sign on with another ship, but the thought of the open water turned your legs to jelly.

You left the world of political machinations behind to earn back their trust.2Insurrectionist: You secretly funded a rebel organization intent on overthrowing the corrupt establishment. Someone discovered your treason, and you were forced to flee or risk execution. You became a hero to live and fight another day on behalf of those who have no power.3Respected Consul: You were a seneschal to a leader, able to sway their opinions. But gossip convinced the leader you were plotting a coup, and you were ousted from their circle of influence. You became a hero to continue your work making meaningful change in the world.4Right Side of History: You tried to work on policy change from the inside of a bureaucratic organization. There were others like you who were more vocal. You started to notice those colleagues were disappearing overnight. Not wanting to find out if you were next on the list, you left to enact change in more direct ways.5Self-Serving: You used your skills to collect incriminating or scandalous information about your opponents to blackmail them.

Saved from public humiliation, you now use your skills for the greater good.6Unbound: The red tape required to achieve anything through your political position resulted in a crisis being mishandled and countless people harmed or killed.

You gathered up what little you had and set off to become a hero, determined to make real change for those society forgot.2Night Terrors: Something killed the other beggars. It came in the night. You barely saw it, but what you did see of it wasn’t natural. You survived by hiding, or perhaps it simply passed you over for reasons unknown to you. It still haunts your nightmares, and you kill monsters so no one else has to experience such horrors.3One Good Deed: You ran afoul of the local watch by being in the wrong place when they were in a bad mood. A passing hero intervened on your behalf, shaming the guards into moving on, then gave you enough gold to get you back on your feet. Their kindness kindled a spark in you. You took the gold, bought some secondhand gear, and went to pay that hero’s kindness forward.4Precious: No matter how far you’d fallen, there was one belonging you would never part with, no matter how much money it would bring you. When a pickpocket stole that object, you chased them until you were in a part of the city you no longer recognized. With a jolt, you realized you had no desire to return to your previous stomping grounds. You kept going, and you haven’t looked back.5Strange Charity: A passerby dropped something in your cup. When you counted your day’s collections, you found a magic coin among the coppers. You knew immediately that it was special. When the other beggars—your friends, you thought—showed that they were ready to murder you for it, you killed several of them in self-defense before you fled, leaving behind the only semblance of community you had.6Witness: You witnessed something you weren’t meant to. Others would kill you if they knew, and they might be searching for you even now. You remain on the move, terrified of remaining in one place too long lest it all catch up to you. Perhaps if you make a big enough name for yourself, you can become untouchable and finally speak of what happened without fear."},"Карьера-(Careers)/Преступник-(Criminal)":{"slug":"Карьера-(Careers)/Преступник-(Criminal)","filePath":"Карьера (Careers)/Преступник (Criminal).md","title":"Преступник (Criminal)","links":["Бонусы-(Perks)/Скрытные-бонусы-(Intrigue-Perks)"],"tags":[],"content":"Вы когда-то работали разбойником, повстанцем, контрабандистом, вне закона или даже убийцей.

To make up for the loss you caused, you left your criminal ways behind and became a hero.3Friendly Priest: You went to prison for your crimes and eventually escaped. An elderly priest took you in and shielded you from the law, convinced that your soul wasn’t corrupt. They never judged you for your past, speaking only of the future. Eventually, the priest died, imparting final words that inspired you to become a hero.4Shadowed Influence: You spent years blackmailing and manipulating nobles for influence and wealth until a scheme went wrong. You were publicly exposed, and after a narrow escape, you reevaluated your life. Under a new identity, you work as a hero and hope no one looks at your past too closely.5Simply Survival: Stealing was a matter of survival for you and not what defined you—at least in your mind. But when your thieving actions led to innocent folk being harmed, you knew you could be better. You turned your back on your old life, though your old skills still come in handy.6Stand Against Tyranny: When a tyrant rose to power in your homeland, they began cracking down on all criminals with deadly raids and public executions.

You saved as many as you could, but the ones you couldn’t save weigh heavily on your mind. You took up the life of a hero to save as many people as possible, vowing that what happened to you then won’t happen again.3Embarrassment: A noble you worked for admonished you publicly for work done poorly—and more than once. Finally, you’d had enough. You vowed to take up a new path and show this noble you’re far more than what they make you out to be.4Live the Dream: You worked with a good friend, and on the job, you would always fantasize about what it would be like to hit the road as adventuring heroes… someday.

Seeing the quick work those heroes made of the bandits inspired you to follow in their footsteps.3Robbery: A criminal gang stole your goods and harmed a number of people who worked for you. You became a hero to prevent such indignities from being visited upon others, to seek revenge for the assault, or to find the thieves and get your stuff back.4Stolen Passions: Your parents discouraged your artistic talents, instead trying to focus your passions on the family business.

You refused to cover for your fellow officers and were told in no uncertain terms to leave town or face the consequences. Now you travel as a hero, acting as the protector you always wanted to be.3Frame Job: Your partner was murdered. That much is irrefutable. But you didn’t do it, despite what the evidence implies.

Might as well help folk in the meantime.6Powerful Enemies: You made it your responsibility to root out and bring down the region’s foremost crime syndicate. They sent goons to burn down your home and teach you a lesson, leaving you bleeding in the street with nothing left except your life. You’ve since taken on the life of a hero to gain the power and influence you need to destroy the syndicate once and for all."},"Карьера-(Careers)/Солдат-(Soldier)":{"slug":"Карьера-(Careers)/Солдат-(Soldier)","filePath":"Карьера (Careers)/Солдат (Soldier).md","title":"Солдат (Soldier)","links":["Бонусы-(Perks)/Исследовательские-бонусы-(Exploration-Perks)"],"tags":[],"content":"В ваши годы становления вы неустанно сражались в стычках и кампаниях против вражеских сил.

You barely escaped the brawl that ensued, but now you vow to help people on your own terms.2Out of Retirement: You had a long and storied career as a soldier before deciding to retire to a simpler life. But when you returned to your old home, you found your enemies had laid waste to it. Now the skills you earned on the battlefield are helping you as you become a different kind of warrior one seeking to save others from the fate you suffered.3Peace Through Healing: Living with constant bloodshed took its toll on you. You seek peace through healing and have dedicated yourself to ending wars before they begin, to spare those around you from the horror.4Sole Survivor: You were the last surviving member of your unit after an arduous battle or monstrous assault, surviving only through luck. You turned away from the life of a soldier then, seeking to become a hero who could stand against such threats.5Stolen Valor: Tired of eking out an existence on the streets, you enrolled in the military. However, you were unable to escape your lower-status background until the officer leading your unit fell in battle. In the chaos that ensued, you assumed their identity and returned home a hero. But when suspicion arose, you took on the life of an adventurer, staying always on the move.6Vow of Sacrifice: You promised a fellow soldier that you’d protect his family if he ever fell in battle.

Now you help others avoid such a fate.2Corruption: A disease has infected the lands you protect, causing animals to become violent and twisting plants into something sinister. You’ve tried everything, magical and mundane, to stop the scourge, but it continues to spread. As such, you’ve set out in search of a cure or an unblighted land to protect.3Exiled: You made a mistake that could not be forgiven. The other wardens of the region decided your fate, exiling you from your lands with an order never to return.4Honor the Fallen: A group of heroes arrived in your territory with trouble close on their heels. You fought alongside them to turn back the evil, but it was too much. The heroes fell, and your wilderness was forever altered. Though your lands are beyond saving, there are other lands you can help.5Portents: There were signs.

You were meant to leave your home territory, meant to fight a battle for the fate of all lands—and so you gave up the only life you’ve ever known.6Theft: You were responsible for guarding something precious, something vital to your region’s survival.

Determined to recall your past, you now dedicate yourself to helping others, hoping your actions will spark some remembrance or lead you to a way to reverse the magic.2Magic of Friendship: As a sign of your status as a star pupil, your mentor gifted you a familiar as a magic pet. Another jealous apprentice captured the familiar and slipped away in the night. Haunted by your pet’s absence, you adventure to find your kidnapped friend and prevent others from feeling your loss.3Missing Mage: One day you woke up and the mage you worked for was gone. They didn’t take any of their belongings and there was no sign of any foul play-only the scent of sulfur in their bedchamber. You set out on your heroic journey in the aftermath and have been looking for them ever since.4Nightmares Made Flesh: Your attempts at magic have always been unpredictable. A powerful mage promised to help you gain control. During your training, a terrible nightmare caused your body to flare with magic and pull the monster of your nightmare into the waking world. The horror escaped. You left, seeking to vanquish their vileness.5Otherworldly: While studying magic, you accidentally sent yourself from your original world to this one. Now you’re stranded here, hoping to find ancient texts or powerful magic treasures that might transport you back home.

They didn’t spend their days behind a desk. They made a real difference. It was time for you to do the same.2Cure the Curse: You used to think knowledge could fix everything. You were wrong. When someone you loved fell under a curse, the means to cure them couldn’t be found in any of the books you owned. But that wasn’t going to stop you. The answers are out there, and you’ll find them even if you have to face down death to do so.3Lost Library: An evil mage took all your books for themself, cackling at your impotence as they raided your shelves. Now, you’re off to search through ancient ruins and secret libraries to rebuild your collection of rare tomes and to find the mage who stole from you.4Paper Guilt: While transcribing ancient texts, you and another scribe discovered a shelf of long-forgotten books. At your suggestion, your companion started work on one and vanished along with the tome. Your guilt drove you to seek out your still-missing friend and prevent others from falling to similar dangers.5Unforeseen Futures: In your pursuit of ancient knowledge, you discovered a prophecy that has yet to come to pass. And that prophecy involves someone who might be… you. Since your discovery, strange dreams have plagued you, driving you to seek out your destiny.6Vanishing: At first you thought it was your imagination, and you brushed off the disappearance of random sentences in historical books. Then as the books changed to entirely blank pages, the disappearances became difficult to ignore, particularly those involving ancient or critical text.

No one knows whether the blight is of natural origin or something more malevolent, but you set out in search of a way to cleanse the land of this affliction.2Bored: You’ve always wanted so much more than gathering eggs and milking cows. You kept a secret journal of your dreams, filled with all the things you wanted. When your parent found the journal, they burned it and told you to keep your head out of the clouds. In response, you gathered what you could in a pack and left everything else behind, seeking a life of adventure.3Cursed: While tilling your fields, you found something in the dirt. Perhaps it was a chipped and dented weapon, a piece of ancient jewelry, or something altogether unique. Excited by your find, you showed it to a loved one, but when they touched it, something happened. You now know it was a curse conveyed by the item, though you don’t know why it affected them and not you. You left your old life in search of answers.4Hard Times: Your farm had always been prosperous, until the last few years. Changes in the weather caused smaller yields until you could no longer pay your tithe to the local noble. Her soldiers took what items of value they found, including a precious family heirloom. You left the struggling farm behind to find a better life.5Razed: Your animals were killed, your crops and home set ablaze. The culprits might have been wandering bandits, raiders from a nearby kingdom, or hired thugs sent by a rival farm. Whoever they were, they left you with nothing. You couldn’t face the thought of starting again from scratch, so you took up a life of heroism to protect others from such villainy.6Stolen: Your family bred horses—beautiful creatures that few could rival on the track and in the jousting lists. When a local noble arrived with an offer to buy your prized stallion, your father refused. The noble struck him down where he stood and stole the horse. Without that stallion, the renowned bloodline would end.

Вы прошли обряд инициации, открывший вам строительные блоки таймскейпа — Первобытный Хаос — и оставивший частицу этого хаоса внутри вас. Выбираете один Первобытный аспект из предложенных ниже; каждый из них даёт вам один Навык. (Быстрая сборка: Берсерк - Berserker.)\n\nБерсерк (Berserker): Вы направляете свою свирепость в физическую Силу, становясь живым воплощением сил, что формируют мир. Вы получаете навык Подъём тяжестей (Lift).\nРазоритель (Reaver): Вы направляете свою свирепость в Интуицию и хитрость, бросая вызов порядку цивилизации. Вы получаете навык Прятаться (Hide).\nБуревестник (Stormwight): Вы направляете свою свирепость в первобытные бури и способны принимать облик зверя или гибридную форму зверя. Вы получаете навык Выслеживание (Track).\n\nВаш Первобытный аспект — это черта вашего подкласса, и выбор аспекта определяет многие особенности, которые вы получите на новых уровнях.\nСвирепость (Ferocity)\nВ разгар битвы ваша решимость и ярость нарастают, подпитывая Героический Ресурс под названием Свирепость.\n\nГде мои Манёвры?\nПоскольку большинство других классов получает уникальный Манёвр, вы можете спросить: «А где особый манёвр для Неистового?» Ответ в том, что классу он просто не нужен, ведь чаще всего воображение рисует образ Неистового, который использует Манёвр Захват (Grab) или Манёвр Отталкивание (Knockback) в бою. Неистовый действительно великолепно владеет этими манёврами, поэтому нет смысла давать вам ещё один вариант, который вы будете использовать редко или вовсе никогда.\n\nСвирепость в бою\nВ начале боевой сцены или иной напряжённой ситуации, ведущейся в раундах боя (по решению Режиссёра), вы получаете количество Свирепости, равное числу ваших Побед. В начале каждого вашего хода в бою вы получаете 1d3 Свирепости.\nКроме того, первый раз за раунд боя, когда вы получаете урон, вы получаете 1 Свирепость. Первый раз за сцену, когда вы становитесь Вымотанным или начинаете умирать, вы получаете 1d3 Свирепости.\nВы теряете всю оставшуюся Свирепость в конце сцены.\nСвирепость вне боя\nХотя вне боя вы не можете получать Свирепость, вы можете использовать свои Героические способности и эффекты, требующие Свирепости, не тратя её. Каждый раз, когда вы используете вне боя способность или эффект, который требует Свирепости, вы не можете использовать эту же способность или эффект снова вне боя, пока не получите хотя бы одну Победу или не завершите Отдых.\nЕсли вы используете вне боя способность, которая позволяет тратить неограниченную Свирепость на эффект (например, До Последнего Вздоха — To the Uttermost End), вы используете её так, словно потратили количество Свирепости, равное числу ваших Побед.\nРастущая Свирепость (Growing Ferocity)\nВы получаете определённые преимущества в бою в зависимости от того, сколько у вас Свирепости (см. Особенности Аспекта 1-го уровня). Эти преимущества длятся до конца вашего хода, даже если в течение хода вы потратите Свирепость и утратите доступ к этим преимуществам.\nНекоторые эффекты Растущей Свирепости становятся доступны только начиная с определённого уровня; минимальный уровень указан в соответствующих таблицах в этом разделе.\nТаблица растущей свирепости — Берсерк\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nСвирепостьПреимущество2Каждый раз, когда вы используете манёвр Отбрасывание (Knockback), дистанция принудительного перемещения увеличивается на величину, равную вашему Силе.4Первый раз за ход, когда вы толкаете существо, вы получаете 1 Всплеск.6Вы получаете Преимущество на проверки Силы и при использовании манёвра Отбрасывание (Knockback).8 (4-й уровень)Первый раз за ход, когда вы толкаете существо, вы получаете 2 Всплеска.10 (7-й уровень)Вы получаете Двойное Преимущество на проверки Силы и при использовании манёвра Отбрасывание (Knockback).12 (10-й уровень)Каждый раз, когда вы используете Героическую способность, вы получаете 10 временной Выносливости.

Эти два Домена составят ваш подкласс, и ваш выбор Доменов определит множество Особенностей, которые вы получите по мере повышения уровня. (Быстрая сборка: Адûn в качестве божества и Жизнь (Life) и Защита(Protection) в качестве Доменов.)\nПочтение (Piety)\nВаше божество дарует вам героический ресурс под названием Почтение, позволяющий вам исцелять и усиливать союзников, а также высвобождать святую мощь на врагов.\nПочтение в бою\nВ начале боевой сцены или другой напряжённой ситуации, ведущейся по раундам боя (по решению Режиссёра), вы получаете Почтение, равное вашим Победам. В начале каждого вашего хода в бою вы получаете 1d3 Почтения.\nКроме того, вы можете получать больше Почтения, молясь богам — но остерегайтесь! Это может легко навлечь их гнев, ведь боги ненавидят, когда их раздражают. Перед тем как сделать бросок на получение Почтения в начале своего хода, вы можете помолиться (не требует действия). Если вы так поступите, ваш бросок получает следующие дополнительные эффекты:\n\nЕсли выпал 1, вы получаете 1 дополнительное Почтение, но гневите богов! Вы получаете психический урон, равный 1d6 + ваш уровень, который нельзя снизить никаким образом.\nЕсли выпал 2, вы получаете 1 дополнительное Почтение.\nЕсли выпал 3, вы получаете 2 дополнительных Почтения и можете активировать эффект домена по вашему выбору (см. ниже).\n\nВы теряете все оставшееся Почтение в конце боевой сцены.\nПочтение вне боя\nХотя вы не можете получать Почтение вне боя, вы можете использовать свои героические способности и эффекты, которые требуют Почтения, не расходуя его. Каждый раз, когда вы используете способность или эффект вне боя, который требует Почтения, вы не можете использовать эту же способность или эффект вне боя снова, пока не заработаете 1 или более Побед или не завершите Отдых.\nКогда вы используете способность вне боя, которая позволяет тратить неограниченное количество Почтения на её эффект (например, Целительная Благодать - Healing Grace), вы можете использовать её так, как если бы потратили количество Почтения, равное вашим Победам.\nПочтение Домена и его Эффекты\nВаш выбор Доменов предоставляет вам два дополнительных способа получать Почтение во время боя, срабатывающих при определённых событиях. Иногда одно событие может активировать оба ваших эффекта доменов. Например, Домен Солнца даёт Почтение, когда находящееся рядом существо получает урон от огня или святой урон, тогда как Домен Войны даёт Почтение, когда находящееся рядом существо получает урон, равный 10 + ваш уровень или выше. Если у вас есть оба этих Домена, и находящееся рядом существо получает соответствующее количество урона от огня, вы получаете Почтение от обоих своих Доменов.\nКроме того, каждый раз, когда вы активируете эффект домена, молясь о Почтении, вы можете выбрать один из своих Доменов, и эффект молитвы этого Домена срабатывает немедленно.\nДомен Творения: Почтение и Эффект\n\nПочтение: Вы получаете 2 Почтения в первый раз за боевую сцену, когда существо в пределах 10 клеток использует способность по области.\nЭффект молитвы: Вы призываете силы творения и создаёте каменную стену в пределах 10 клеток, размер которой равен 5 + ваш показатель Интуиции. Стена существует до конца боевой сцены.\n\nДомен Смерти: Почтение и Эффект\n\nПочтение: Вы получаете 2 Почтения в первый раз за боевую сцену, когда существо (не миньон) в пределах 10 клеток снижается до 0 Выносливости, или когда соло-противник в пределах 10 клеток становится **вымотанным.\nЭффект молитвы: Вы насылаете смертельное проклятие на двух врагов в пределах 10 клеток. Каждый цель получает урон порчей, равный двойному значению вашего показателя Интуиции.\n\n\nДомен Судьбы: Почтение и Эффект\n\nПочтение: Вы получаете 2 Почтения в первый раз за боевую сцену, когда союзник в пределах 10 клеток получает результат 3-го ранга на Броске Могущества, или враг в пределах 10 клеток получает результат 1-го ранга на Броске Могущества.\nЭффект молитвы: Вы призываете силы судьбы для создания предсказуемого будущего. Выберите существо в пределах 10 клеток. Оно автоматически получает результат 1-го или 3-го ранга (на ваш выбор) на свой следующий Бросок Могущества, совершённый до конца боевой сцены.\n\nДомен Знаний: Почтение и Эффект\n\nПочтение: Вы получаете 2 Почтения в первый раз за боевую сцену, когда Режиссёр тратит Злоба.\nЭффект молитвы: Выберите до пяти союзников в пределах 10 клеток, либо выберите себя вместо одного из них. Каждая цель получает 1 Всплеск.\n\nДомен Жизни: Почтение и Эффект\n\nПочтение: Вы получаете 2 Почтения в первый раз за боевую сцену, когда существо в пределах 10 клеток восстанавливает Выносливость.\nЭффект молитвы: Выберите себя или союзника в пределах 10 клеток. Этот персонаж может потратить Восстановление, прекратить один эффект, который завершается спасброском или в конце его хода, либо встать, если он повален. Либо вы или союзник в пределах 10 клеток получаете временную Выносливость, равную двум значениям вашего показателя Интуиции.\n\nДомен Любви: Почтение и Эффект\n\nПочтение: Вы получаете 2 Почтения в первый раз за боевую сцену, когда вы или союзник в пределах 10 клеток используют манёвр Помочь атаковать (Aid Attack) или способность, нацеленную на союзника.\nЭффект молитвы: Каждый союзник в пределах 10 клеток получает временную Выносливость, равную двум значениям вашего показателя Интуиции.\n\nДомен Природы: Почтение и Эффект\n\nПочтение: Вы получаете 2 Почтения в первый раз за боевую сцену, когда вы или существо в пределах 10 клеток получает **урон кислотой, холодом, огнём, молнией, ядом или звуком.\nЭффект молитвы: Лозы вырываются из земли в пределах 10 клеток, опутывая количество существ, равное вашему показателю Интуиции. Вы можете сдвинуть (slide) каждое из них на количество клеток, равное вашему показателю Интуиции. Затем лозы исчезают.\n\nДомен Защиты: Почтение и Эффект\n\nПочтение: Вы получаете 2 Почтения в первый раз за боевую сцену, когда вы или союзник в пределах 10 клеток получают временную Выносливость или используют Реакцию, чтобы уменьшить входящий урон или наложить Помеху/Двойную Помеху на Бросок Могущества врага.\nЭффект молитвы: Один союзник в пределах 10 клеток получает временную Выносливость, равную четырём значениям вашего показателя Интуиции.\n\nДомен Шторма: Почтение и Эффект\n\nПочтение: Вы получаете 2 Почтения в первый раз за боевую сцену, когда враг в пределах 10 клеток подвергается принудительному перемещению.\nЭффект молитвы: Каждый враг в кубе 3×3 в пределах 10 клеток получает урон молнией, равный двойному значению вашего показателя Интуиции.\n\nДомен Солнца: Почтение и Эффект\n\nПочтение: Вы получаете 2 Почтения в первый раз за боевую сцену, когда враг в пределах 10 клеток получает урон огнём или святой урон.\nЭффект молитвы: Один враг в пределах 10 клеток получает урон огнём, равный тройному значению вашего показателя Интуиции.\n\nДомен Обмана: Почтение и Эффект\n\nПочтение: Вы получаете 2 Почтения в первый раз за боевую сцену, когда вы или существо в пределах 10 клеток используют манёвр Помочь атаковать (Aid Attack) или Скрыться.\nЭффект молитвы: Вы сдвигаете одно существо в пределах 10 клеток на количество клеток, равное 5 + ваш уровень Проводника.\n\nДомен Войны: Почтение и Эффект\n\nПочтение: Вы получаете 2 Почтения в первый раз за боевую сцену, когда вы или существо в пределах 10 клеток получает урон, превышающий 10 + ваш уровень, за один ход.\nЭффект молитвы: Выберите до трёх союзников в пределах 10 клеток, либо выберите себя вместо одного из них. Каждая цель получает 2 Всплеска.\n\nОсобенности домена Проводника 1-го уровня\nВыберите один из ваших доменов.

Вы также обладаете большим количеством навыков, чем любой другой герой.\n\n“Когда есть сомнение — нет сомнения.”\nДевиз Коллегии Чёрного Пепла\n\nОсновы\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nСтартовые характеристикиВы начинаете с Ловкости 2, и вы можете выбрать один из следующих наборов значений ваших других характеристик. 2, 2, −1, −12, 1, 1, −12, 1, 0, 01, 1, 1, 0Слабая мощностьЛовкость - 2Средняя мощностьЛовкость - 1Cильная мощностьЛовкостьВыносливость на 1-м уровне18Выносливость, получаемая на 2-м и следующих уровнях6Восстановления8НавыкиВы получаете навык Прятаться и Красться, затем выберите любые пять навыков из Преступного мира (Criminal Underworld) либо навыки из исследовательских, межличностных или скрытных навыков (Быстрое создание: Преступный мир, Прятаться, Ложь, Взлом, Карманная кража, Саботаж, Красться)\nТаблица развития Тени\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevelFeaturesAbilitiesCollege Abilities1stКоллегия Тени, Проницательность, Особенности коллегии 1-го уровня, Реакция коллеги, Колебание — это слабость, Комплект, Shadow AbilitiesSignature, 3, 5-2ndCollege Feature, Perk, College AbilitySignature, 3, 553rdCareful Observation, 7-Insight AbilitySignature, 3, 5, 754thCharacteristic Increase, Keep It Down, Night Watch, Perk, Skill, Surge of InsightSignature, 3, 5, 755thCollege Feature, 9-Insight AbilitySignature, 3, 5, 7, 956thPerk, Umbral Form, College AbilitySignature, 3, 5, 7, 95, 97thCharacteristic Increase, Keen Insight, Skill, Careful Observation Improvement, VentriloquistSignature, 3, 5, 7, 95, 98thCollege Feature, Perk, 11-Insight AbilitySignature, 3, 5, 7, 9, 115, 99thGloom Squad, College AbilitySignature, 3, 5, 7, 9, 115, 9, 1110thCharacteristic Increase, Death Pool, Perk, Skill, Careful Observation Improvement, Improved Umbral Form, SubterfugeSignature, 3, 5, 7, 9, 115, 9, 11\nОсобенности 1-го уровня\nНа 1-м уровне Тень получает следующие особенности.\nКоллегия Тени (Shadow College)\nКоллегии Тени — это тайные организации, превращающие обычных людей во что-то иное. Найти такую коллегию — это первый шаг в строгом процессе инициации, который проверяет рвение кандидата. Даже те, кто проходит отбор, часто отсеиваются или исключаются, ведь мастера тени, обучающие студентов скрытности, магии и убийству, далеко не всегда бывают снисходительными.\nВы окончили одну из коллегий тени, каждая из которых даёт вам определённый навык.\n(Быстрая сборка: Коллегия Чёрного Пепла - College of Black Ash.)\n\nКоллегия Чёрного Пепла (College of Black Ash): Коллегия Чёрного Пепла заложила основы искусства быть Тенью. Её выпускники непревзойдённы в мобильности, благодаря использованию магии для телепортации по полю боя, манипуляции тенями и призыву тьмы. Вы получаете навык Магия.\nКоллегия Едкой Алхимии (College of Caustic Alchemy): Студентов этой коллегии обучают рецептам кислот, бомб и ядов для их мрачной работы. Выпускники коллегии — исключительные убийцы. Вы получаете навык Алхимия.\nКоллегия Маски Арлекина (Harlequin Mask): Выпускники этой коллегии осваивают магию иллюзий, которую используют для проникновения в крепости врагов и создания управляемого хаоса на поле боя. Вы получаете навык Ложь.\n\nВаша коллегия Тени является вашей специализацией подкласса, а выбор коллегии определяет многие особенности, которые вы получите по мере повышения уровня.\nПроницательность (Insight)\nНаблюдая за врагом, вы учитесь использовать его слабости против него, накапливая Героический Ресурс под названием Проницательность.\nПроницательность в бою\nВ начале боевой сцены или другой стрессовой ситуации, отслеживаемой в боевых раундах (по решению Режиссёра), вы получаете количество проницательности, равное вашим Победам. В начале каждого вашего хода в бою вы получаете 1d3 проницательности.\nДополнительно, в первый раз в каждом боевом раунде, когда вы наносите урон с использованием 1 или более Всплеска, вы получаете 1 проницательность.\nКаждый раз, когда вы используете героическую способность с Броском Могущества, её стоимость в проницательности уменьшается на 1, если у вас есть Преимущество или Двойное преимущество на этот бросок. Если способность поражает несколько целей, стоимость уменьшается, даже если Преимущество или Двойное преимущество действует только на одну цель.\nЛюбая оставшаяся проницательность теряется в конце боевой сцены.\nПроницательность вне боя\nХотя вы не можете получать проницательность вне боя, вы можете использовать свои героические способности и эффекты, требующие проницательность, без её расхода. Каждый раз, когда вы используете способность или эффект вне боя, требующий проницательность, вы не можете использовать ту же способность или эффект вне боя снова, пока не заработаете 1 или более Побед или не закончите отдых.\nЕсли вы используете способность вне боя, которая позволяет тратить неограниченное количество проницательности на её эффект (как Black Ash Teleport) вы можете использовать её так, как если бы потратили количество проницательности, равное вашим Победам.\nОсобенности коллегии 1-го уровня (1st-Level College Features)\nВаша теневая коллегия даёт одну или две особенности, как показано в таблице особенностей колледжа 1-го уровня.\nТаблица особенностей колледжа 1-го уровня\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nКолледжОсобенностьЧёрный Пепел (Black Ash)Телепортация Чёрного Пепла (Black Ash Teleport)Едкая Алхимия (Caustic Alchemy)Покрыть Клинок (Coat the Blade), Дымовая Бомба (Smoke Bomb)Маска Арлекина (Harlequin Mask)Я не Угроза (I’m No Threat)\nТелепортация Чёрного Пепла (Black Ash Teleport)\nВы получаете следующую способность.\nname: Телепортация Чёрного Пепла (Black Ash Teleport)\nflavor: В вихре чёрного пепла вы перемещаетесь с одного места на другое.\nkeywords: Магия\ntype: Манёвр\ndistance: На себя\ntarget: На себя\neffects:\n- Эффект: Телепортируетесь на 5 клеток.

Вы можете выглядеть как безобидное животное вашего размера, например как овца или капибара, или вы можете предстать как менее героическая и безоружная версия себя. Пока действует иллюзия, ваши удары получают Преимущество, а при Отступлении вы получаете +1 к расстоянию сдвига. Иллюзия исчезает, когда вы атакуете другое существо, когда физически взаимодействуете с существом или когда заканчиваете иллюзию (действия не требуется). Если вы заканчиваете иллюзию, атакуя другое существо, вы получаете 1 Всплеск.\n- Трата 1 Проницательности: Выберите существо в пределах 10 клеток, размер которого не больше вашего размера + 1. Иллюзия делает вас похожим на выбранное существо, включая одежду и броню, и изменяет голос чтобы вы звучали как это существо. Вы получаете Преимущество на проверки убеждения союзников существа, что вы это существо.\n \nДымовая Бомба (Smoke Bomb)\nВы всегда носите с собой запас дымовых бомб для отвлечения и побега.

Каждый раз, когда вы используете постоянную способность, вы решаете, хотите ли вы её поддерживать, и начинаете поддерживать сразу после первого применения способности.\nЕсли вы поддерживаете постоянную способность в бою, количество эссенции, которую вы получаете в начале своего хода, уменьшается на величину, равную значению постоянного эффекта способности. Это позволяет поддерживать постоянный эффект способности. Все ваши активные постоянные способности заканчиваются в конце ситуации (encounter).\nВы не можете поддерживать способности, которые заставили бы вас получать отрицательное количество эссенции в начале вашего хода. Вы можете прекратить поддержание способности в любое время (действие не требуется).\nЕсли вы поддерживаете одну и ту же способность на нескольких целях и эффект включает бросок могущества, вы делаете этот бросок один раз и применяете тот же эффект ко всем целям. Существо не может быть затронуто несколькими экземплярами одной и той же постоянной способности.\nЕсли вы получаете урон, равный или превышающий 5 × ваше значение Разума за один ход, вы прекращаете поддержание всех постоянных способностей. Например, если ваш Разум равен 2 и вы поддерживаете Мгновенную Раскопку, получение 10 или более урона за один ход заставляет вас прекратить поддержание способности.\nПрактическая магия (Practical Magic)\nВы получаете следующую особенность\nname: Практическая магия (Practical Magic)\nflavor: Ваше мастерство элементальной энергии позволяет вам изменять ваши заклинания (conjurations)\ntype: Манёвр\ndistance: На себя\ntarget: На себя\nkeywords: Магия\neffects:\n- Effect: Выберите один из следующих эффектов 1.

Это существо получает урон этим типом урона равному значению Разума. 3. Вы телепортируетесь на количество клеток равное вашему значению Разума. Если вы выберите этот вариант, вы можете потратить эссенцию, чтобы телепортироваться на 1 дополнительную клетку за каждую потраченную эссенцию. \nОсобенность специализации 1-го уровня\nВаша элементальная специализация дарует вам особенность, указанную в таблице особенностей 1 уровня.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nСпециализацияОсобенностьЗемляВдохновить Землю (Motivate Earth)ОгоньВозврат к Бесформенности (Return to Formlessness)ЗеленьДуша, Которая Слышит (It Is the Soul Which Hears)ПустотаЗа гранью зрения (A Beyonding of Vision)\nЗа гранью зрения (A Beyonding of Vision)\nВы мгновенно распознаёте иллюзии, видите невидимых существ, а сверхъестественные эффекты не могут скрывать существ и объекты от вас.

Времена, когда небожители ещё присутствовали в мире, и всё, что имело значение, было искусство и красота.\nЗа тысячелетия, прошедшие с тех пор, как их создатели ушли в Аркадию, высшие эльфы построили цивилизацию для самих себя, в основном обитая среди упавших небесных городов и в них самих. Без создателей, которых нужно было бы радовать, эльфы продолжают жить, как и прежде — собирая знания и мудрость, поклоняясь искусству и с каждым поколением становясь всё более замкнутыми и недоверчивыми к чужакам.\nО высших эльфах\n«Они такие красивые», — сказала Венна. «Трудно представить, что мы в\nопасности».\n«Это не так уж и трудно», — мрачно ответил Дэйд.\nПятеро детей стояли одни в центре большого круглого двора под открытым небом, а рядом с ними был их эскорт из Дромовых эльфов, Ллиандер.\nЛорд Слеза, король высших эльфов, сидел на мраморном троне, держа свиток Кодекса Дриадалис на коленях. Он не произнес ни слова с тех пор, как Ллиандер произнес речь и передал ему кодекс. Члены двора, дворяне, придворные и ученые мудрецы собрались, чтобы наблюдать за происходящим.\nНеумолимые воины в золотых доспехах с тонкой филигранью, выгравированной на металле, стояли на страже по периметру.\n«Они похожи на…» — сказала Мелиора, подбирая слова.\n«На повелителей всего мира», — с благоговением и изумлением сказала Венна.\n«А мы их пленники», — сказал Джереми, глядя на своего брата Дейда и Кредана, рядом с ним.\n«Вы не пленники», — тихо сказал Ллиандер. «Вы гости. Здесь вы в большей безопасности, чем даже в своих собственных домах».\n«Да», — сказал Джереми, глядя на ближайших стражников с их длинными копьями и мечами. «Мы чувствуем себя в полной безопасности».\n«Кого ты обманываешь?» — сказал Дэйд. «Все знают, как сильно эльфы ненавидят людей».\nНа это лорд Слеза обменялся взглядом с Ллиандером, консортом королевы Имирр. Это был многозначительный взгляд, полный печали и меланхолии. Затем он нарушил молчание.\n«Покажите мне эльфа, который ненавидит людей, — сказал он глубоким и звонким голосом, — и я покажу вам эльфа, который любил человека и видел, как он старел и умирал». Он впервые посмотрел на детей и улыбнулся меланхоличной улыбкой. «Любовь для нас — как солнечный свет, понимаете. Мы любим целиком, но редко. Потеря любви означает для нас вечность скорби».\nКороль постучал свитком по коленям, словно приняв решение. «Молодец, консорт. Молодые люди, Ваш проводник стремится опозорить меня. Ведь он прекрасно знает, что мог бы отнести эту награду своей королеве и заслужить ее благосклонность. Вместо этого Лиландер принес ее мне в надежде, что таким образом он даст мне силу, необходимую для того, чтобы сбросить иго правления Аякса. Ллиандер давно возмущался моим решением и стремился изменить его…» — он посмотрел на Ллиандера — «…изменив мое мнение».\nЛлиандер почтительно кивнул, молча поздравляя короля с его проницательностью.\n«Увы, усилия вашего проводника напрасны». Затем лицо короля смягчилось. Он поднял тяжелый свиток. «Но это не пустое дело», — сказал он. «Мы заключили с Аяксом договор о передаче ему всех артефактов, которые наши поисковые группы обнаружат в руинах этого города. Он выигрывает от этой сделки больше, чем мы. Но это, видится мне, останется у нас. Он был написан бабушкой моей бабушки в молодости мира,\nи есть некоторые вещи, которые должны быть отказаны Железному Святому, даже если они нарушают договор».\nЛлиандер повернулся к детям и широко улыбнулся, поднимая брови\nв знак радости. Венна и Кредан не могли не улыбнуться в ответ.\n«Ну, видите, дети?» — сказал Ллиандер. «Нам осталось сделать только больше, а не все». Король встал, и глашатай рядом с троном объявил: «Соберитесь и слушайте! Лорд Падшего Ирраниса, Утренняя Роса на Единственном Листе,\nПодобная Слезе Солнца, говорит. И знайте, что его слово — закон!»\nЛорд Слеза спустился по ступенькам и остановился перед детьми, столь же высокий, как и Ллиандер. Его лицо было благородным и красивым. Пряди серебристого дыма рассеялись по его золотистой коже. Он казался одновременно вечным и молодым.\n«Вы слышали многое о моем народе, но вот что вам следует знать прежде всего. Мы ценим не знание ради знания, но прежде всего и превыше всего красоту. И правда для нас — это своего рода красота. Поэтому мы считаем знание прекрасным.»\nЛорд Слеза спустился по ступенькам и остановился перед детьми, столь же высокий, как и Ллиандер. Его лицо было благородным и красивым.

Мы ценим не знание ради знания, но прежде всего и превыше всего красоту. И правда для нас — это своего рода красота. Поэтому мы считаем знание прекрасным.\n«Вы вернули нечто не только обладающее огромной мировой силой, но в то же время произведение искусства, над которым мой древний родственник трудился в течение многих ваших веков. То, что оно вернулось ко мне сейчас, — это своего рода чудо. Я не забуду этого. Вы приобрели союзника в лице владыки высших эльфов. И хотя ваша жизнь коротка, пока вы живы, вы будете пользоваться благосклонностью эльфов». Он повернулся, чтобы передать свиток мудрецу и посоветоваться со своим глашатаем.\n«Он кажется мудрым», — сказал Кредан.\n«И умным», — добавила Мелиора.\n«Я удивлен тем, насколько он добр», — сказал Джереми. «Он кажется хорошим королем».\nЛлиандер усмехнулся. Венна это заметила. Сначала она ничего не сказала, но в конце концов не смогла удержаться. «Что?»\nЛлиандер поднял бровь, затем прошел перед детьми, чтобы когда лесной эльф заговорил, его спина была повёрнута к королю.\n«Помните, как солдаты моего кузена спрятались в дроме?» сказал он тихим голосом. «Как вы были удивлены?»\nВенна и Мелиора кивнули. Ллиандер кивнул стражникам и гостям. «Это их очарование. Что бы вы ни находили приятным и привлекательным в другом, вы видите именно это в них. Если вы цените хорошую шутку, они для вас шуты. Если вы цените красоту, они для вас неотразимы. Если вы находите интеллект привлекательным, они для вас мудрецы. Это не только эффект внешности, хотя и это тоже. Это эффект поведения».\n«Но как они делают…»\nЛлиандер приложил палец к губам, заставляя замолчать юную Мелиору. «Это не что-то, что они делают. Это эффект в твоем сознании».\n«Ты хочешь сказать, что они даже не знают, что делают это?» — спросила Мелиора.\n«Тогда как они на самом деле выглядят?» — спросила Венна.\nЛлиандер пожал плечами. «А как на самом деле выглядят все остальные?» И пока остальные дети списывали это на обычно заумный стиль общения своего сопровождающего, Мелиора уловила проблеск понимания где-то в своем сознании.\nКороль повернулся к ним. «Если кто-то из вас ищет скрытые знания\nили глубокую мудрость, позвольте мне помочь вам в первую очередь. Но ты, юная девушка, человеческое дитя, которое выучило наш язык, я называю тебя другом эльфов. И мое наречение имеет силу. Ты обнаружишь, что изучение наших знаний дается тебе легче, и все те, кто по-прежнему почитают эльфов, обеспечат тебе безопасный проход по своим землям».\nЛлиандер положил руки на бедра и посмотрел на детей. «Неплохо для вашего второго задания. Что вы будете делать дальше?»\nЧерты Высших эльфов\nГерои Высшие эльфы имеют доступ к следующим чертам\nЗнаковая черта: Чары Высших эльфов (High Elf Glamor)\nМагический гламур заставляет других воспринимать вас как интересного и обаятельного, предоставляя преимущество на проверки Присутствия (Presence), использующие умения «Флирт» (Flirt) или «Убеждение» (Persuade).

Они наслаждаются репутацией опытных инженеров и технологов в Ордене благодаря знаниям, унаследованным от их старших братьев, давно вымерших стальных дварфов.\nДварфы — дети древнего бога Орда, и распространенная фраза среди дварфов — «Орд создал мир» — их способ сказать: «Чему быть, того не миновать». Они очень гордятся тем, что их бог вместе с Аан, Эт и Кулом создал мир, и многие дварфы покидают свои дома, чтобы увидеть мир и прославиться во имя Орда.\nО Дварфах\n«Они могут быть упрямыми», — сказала Эмберс. Джон улыбнулся и посмотрел на нее, когда они обходили сарай. «Да, не то что эльфы и люди, верно?» Эмберс улыбнулась. «Они хороши в бою», — сказал Джон, и его тон подразумевал, что это все, что имеет значение. «Они прирожденные командиры».\n«Да, я могу себе представить, почему», — сказала Эмберс. «Каждая фраза звучит как приказ».\nОни нашли дварфа на краю старого карьера за городом, режущим каменные блоки длинной медной пилой. Обычно на это уходило четверть часа у двух человек, но дварф распилил весь блок пополам одним движением. Камни дымились, когда падали, а медная пила светилась от жара.\nДжон и Эмберс молча наблюдали, как дварф поднял еще один массивный камень на режущий блок.\nДварф плюнул в ладони и заметил их краем глаза. Он остановился, подошел, чтобы взять свой боевой посох с символом песочных часов Зарока Законодателя, на конце. Он вернулся к камню и прислонил посох к пню дерева, чтобы он был под рукой, если понадобится его использовать.\nОн вернулся к работе.\n«Доброе утро», — сказал Джон.\nГном проигнорировал их.\n«Я друг Мораг, Мудрой Женщины», — сказал Джон. «Она сказала, что здесь где-то работает старший теохрон Зарока Законодателя, чтобы заработать на пропитание».\nДварф сделал паузу. «Старший теохрон?» — сказал он. «Высокий титул. Слишком высокий для такой работы», — он вернулся к работе, и через мгновение появились еще два дымящихся блока. Он убрал их.\n«Есть работа для девяти…» Джон замялся. Крысоловы не казались подходящими. Он пошел на поводу у интуиции. «Героев. В Бедегаре. Деревня ищет кого-нибудь, кто сможет противостоять лорду Сакстону».\n«Мм. Я слышал об этом», — сказал гном, казалось, не проявляя интереса. Он бросил меньшие блоки в кучу и пошел поднимать новый камень, чтобы отрезать его. «Мерзкий тиран. Хорошо подходит для этих времен. Возможно, народ заслуживает его».\n«Ни один народ не заслуживает тирании», — сказала Эмберс, и в ее голосе прозвучала резкость. Дварф, казалось, впервые заметил ее, пристально посмотрел на нее, оценил ее одежду и вернулся к работе.\n«Девятеро против Сакстона». Дварф поднял огромный блок над головой и отнес его к режущему камню. Он недоверчиво покачал головой, услышав, о чем его просят. «Как велика оппозиция?»\nДжон сказал ему.\nДварф в изумлении уронил камень и уставился на человека и эльфа. Затем он улыбнулся. «Ха. Вы хорошо знаете наши традиции, сэр рыцарь. Вы хотите даровать мне славную смерть, возглавив отчаявшихся солдат против невыполнимой задачи».\n«Не настолько отчаявшихся», скромно сказал Джон.\n«Да». Дварф снова посмотрел на Эмберс. «По одежде и репутации предполагаю тебя Туманом, Окутывающим Умирающие Янтари, хозяйкой Башни Перевода. Тебе не чужда власть. Но твоя башня падала, леди», сказал он. «Ты ищешь мести? Или справедливости?»\n«Я не вижу причин выбирать», — ровно ответила Эмберс. «В моем случае, как и в случае этих деревенских жителей, справедливость будет местью».\nГолова дварфа резко повернулась к сэру Джону. «Похоже, она говорит и на моем языке. Вы сродни друг другу, вы двое».\n«Трое», — осмелился сказать Джон.\nДварф не смог сдержать улыбку. «И какова ваша доля в этом деле?»\nДжон пожал плечами. «Мне уже заплатили», — сказал он. Он порылся в сумке на поясе. «Вот, я поделюсь с тобой, честно и справедливо».\nДжон смахнул монету с указательного пальца большим. Она закружилась и заблестела, пролетая по дуге между ними. Дварф схватил ее из воздуха, открыл ладонь и уставился на нее. Что-то в его лице изменилось. Смягчилось. Он посмотрел на близлежащий город, который принял его. На крестьянн, работающих в полях.\nОн сжал монету в кулаке. «Крупная сумма», — сказал он, в основном сам себе.\n«Ты — Дазар», — осмелился сказать Эмберс. «Старший теохрон в изгнании. Твоя — величайшая гномья церковь во всей земле Омунда. Тысячи обращаются к тебе за\nдуховным руководством».\nДварф ничего не ответил. Он посмотрел на монету в своей руке.\n«Ты бросил свой народ», — тихо сказал Эмберс.\n«Мой народ бросил меня! — рявкнул Дазар. — Когда они приняли Аякса!»\nЭмберс просто смотрела на гнома. Его ярость улеглась так же быстро, как и возникла.\n«Я думал… Я думал, что мой уход вдохновит мой народ на…»\nОн посмотрел на близлежащую деревню. «Эх, неважно. Я все равно не смог бы остаться. У меня кишка тонка для тирании».\n«Новый тан Кала Калавара это нелегкая проблема, — сочувственно сказал Джон. — Сакстон — легкая».\nГном посмотрел на Эмберса: «Ее я знаю по слухам». Он\nповернулся к Джону.\nДжон слегка поклонился. «Джон», — сказал он.\nДазар посмотрел на его доспехи, на их возраст и изношенность, и сделал интуитивный вывод. «Вы служили под началом Доброго Короля».\nДжон сжал губы. «Это было давно».\nДазар покачал головой. «Но не для меня». Он поднял свой боевой посох и сделал шаг вперед. «Я знал его, видите ли. Омунд был прекрасным королем. Лучшим из всех, кого мы увидим даже за всю мою долгую жизнь».\nНа мгновение все замолчали. «Эти ребята», — сказал Дазар. «Эти сельские жители. Они знают, о чем просят?»\nДжон не ответил.\n«Они знают, что, прося нас о помощи, прося тебя», — Дазар оглядел сэра Джона с ног до головы, — «…они начинают дело, которое должны довести до конца? Это означает лишения, бедствия, смерть, чтобы обеспечить будущее для своих детей? Ты им это сказал?»\nДжон покачал головой.\n«Почему нет?!» — спросил Дазар. «Ты, как никто другой, должен понять…»\n«Дазар», — сказал Джон, и его сдержанный голос был быстрой реакцией на протест Дазара. «Эти люди и так уже на пределе. Они просто… просто выживают, кормят своих детей, согревают их. Дают им надежду. Это уже больше, чем можно требовать от кого-либо. А потом они приходят к нам, проглатывая свою гордость. Просят нас о помощи.\n«Наша задача — понять их положение». Затем, уже тише, Джон добавил: «И заранее простить их, когда они ослабеют и поддадутся страху».\nДазар уставился на этого человека, рыцаря Тора, и посмотрел на Эмберс, тихо излучающую гордость за своего друга.\n«Хм», — пробурчал Дазар. Он открыл сумку на грудной броне и вставил монету. «Мы должны найти трубадура, чтобы рассказать историю о падении Сакстона. Не могу дождаться, чтобы услышать, чем все закончится!» Он прошел между ними, неся свой посох на плече.\n«Пойдемте!» — рявкнул он. «Мир нуждается в исправлении! Почему мы здесь бездельничаем?»\nДжон безумно улыбался Эмберс. Она подняла три пальца.\nЧерты Дварфов\nГероям дварфам доступны следующие черты:\nЗнаковая черта: Вырезание Рун (Runic Carving)\nВы вырезаете руну на своей коже в течении 10 минут непрерывного времени.

Малые популяции драконидов в Кемхаре, Хигаре и Кхурсире подтверждают это. Потомки первых поколений, созданных могущественными волшебниками тысячелетия назад, они никогда не были многочисленны. В типичном выводке рождается лишь одно яйцо. Уже через несколько поколений у драконидов появляются новые адаптации, такие как перья или гребневые выросты.\nКрупнейшая ныне существующая популяция драконидов — остатки Драконьей Фаланги в Васлории. Созданная волшебником Витае при добром короле Омунде, Драконья Фаланга когда-то насчитывала несколько тысяч величайших рыцарей короля, обеспечивая соблюдение закона по всей земле.\nРыцарство было титулом, носимым каждым членом того первого поколения драконьих рыцарей. В рядах Драконьей Фаланги были Тени, Цензоры, Тактики и Элементалисты. Почти каждое героическое призвание было представлено в одной из восьми драконьих эскадрилий, составлявших фалангу. Более 30 лет эти герои были символом справедливости, защищая слабых от сильных и стоя между простыми людьми и теми, кто стремился к власти над другими. Те, кто вырос в том месте и времени, не могли представить иной образ жизни.\nПотом пришёл Аякс.\nО Драконьих Рыцарях\nФигура в плаще, стоящая в задней части таверны, встала. Когда она это сделала, ее капюшон соскользнул, обнажив голову и лицо. По толпе прошел шепот. Один мужчина, стоявший у бара, открыл рот от удивления, а затем уронил свой кувшин с медовухой.\nВысокий, широкоплечий драконид вышел на свет. Он был стар, его чешуя была изрезана боевыми шрамами. Одной когтистой рукой он опирался на рукоять булавы, которая висела на петле его пояса, а другой держал щит за ремень. Его спокойный, бесстрастный взгляд был страшнее любого угрожающего зырканья. Три человеческих бандита сделали шаг назад. Один из дварфов лишь усмехнулся, но, почувствовав нежелание своих человеческих соратников, повернулся к ним.\n«В чём дело?» — прорычал главный дварф. Глядя на драконьего рыцаря, другой бандит быстро добавил: «Мы не знали, что здесь есть один из вас».\nДраконид не шелохнулся. Не дал понять, что услышал человека. Просто немигающим взглядом смотрел на главного дварфа. «Подумай о награде», — прошипел дварф людям, не спуская, однако, глаз с драконида.\n«Мы все разбогатеем».\nДва дварфа оглядели таверну. Все вокруг теперь смотрели на них. Некоторые встали. Они больше не боялись.\n«Мы еще вернемся», — сказал главный дварф, и группа вышла из таверны, вложив короткие мечи в ножны, прежде чем повернуться и уйти.\nВсе в таверне повернулись и посмотрели с нескрываемым восхищением на драконьего рыцаря. Он заметил это, опустил голову, чтобы избежать их взглядов. «Шоу закончилось», — прорычал он, а затем повернулся, чтобы вернуться на свое место в задней части зала.\nНевысокий, храбрящийся мужчина средних лет встал, и две столь же храбрящихся женщины за тем же столом встали вместе с ним.\n«Простите, сэр рыцарь», — сказал мужчина, когда драконий рыцарь прошел мимо их стола. Рыцарь прошел мимо, игнорируя их. Мужчина вытянул руку и схватил огромного дракона за плечо. Рыцарь обернулся к крестьянину, нависая над ним.\nМужчина коснулся своего чела. Две женщины, которые были с ним, сделали реверанс. «Простите, сэр, но мы вас искали». Рыцарь-дракон усмехнулся и обнажил острые зубы. «Ищите кого-нибудь другого», — прорычал он, выдергивая руку.\nМужчина быстро обошел дракона и встал перед ним, преградив ему путь. Он снял свою поношенную шапку и поднял ее над грудью.\n«Простите, сэр, но больше никого нет. Видите ли, новый барон ввел новый налог. А священник говорит, что он от святого Аякса».\nРыцарь оскалил свои впечатляющие зубы, готовый отпугнуть Джаго и других двоих, когда кто-то еще заговорил.\n«Тебе возможно стоит их выслушать, Ваант», — прозвучал голос со стола, за которым сидели трое крестьян. Драконий рыцарь резко повернулся, чтобы посмотреть на человека, который заговорил. Его спина была обращена к дракониду, но голос его выдал.\n«Джон?»\nМужчина повернулся, чтобы посмотреть вверх.\n«Привет, Ваант», — сказал он, улыбаясь. Он встал из-за стола. Он был средних лет, в хорошей физической форме. Черные волосы свисали ему на плечи. Он был вооружен разнообразным оружием. «Ребята, — сказал он, — это Ваантикалисакс, рыцарь короля Омунда из Громовой Фаланги. Возможно, он последний из Рыцарей Бури».\nМужчина протянул руку. Рыцарь-дракон посмотрел на нее на мгновение, а затем медленно потянулся, чтобы сжать ее.\n«Что ты здесь делаешь?» — спросил он.\n«Этим людям нужна помощь. Я обещал найти ее. Слышал слухи, что кто-то, подходящий под твое описание, заперся здесь и устраивает соревнование по питью с мистером Джоном Барликорном».\nДраконий рыцарь фыркнул и отпустил руку Джона.\n«Пускай», — сказал он. «Но почему я?»\n«Подумал, что, может, ты захочешь вернуться в игру».\n«В игру».\n«Да». Сэр Джон улыбнулся. «В игру героев».\nВ таверне в основном возобновилась обычная жизнь, но трое крестьян внимательно наблюдали за происходящим. В конце концов драконий рыцарь снова заговорил, его голос\nбыл тихим.\n«Я много тебе должен, Джон, но не всё».\n«Я не прошу всего».\n«Нет, не с этого всё начинается. Но у меня такое чувство, что так всё и закончится».\n«Что гласит твоя клятва? „Даже если солнце остановится в небе, даже если ночь…“»\n«Джон», — сказал драконий рыцарь, и в его голосе вдруг прозвучала печаль. Раздражение.\n«Ты не хочешь цитировать мне мою клятву. Ты правда не хочешь. Мне нравилось служить с тобой. У меня остались теплые воспоминания об этом времени — о тебе. Не порти их». Он посмотрел на своего друга, на трех крестьян, затем покачал головой и повернулся, чтобы выйти из таверны.\n«Ваант», — сказал сэр Джон, следуя за ним. «Сэр Ваантикалисакс, клятвою твоей!»\nРыцарь-дракон остановился и резко обернулся. Все в таверне снова наблюдали за представлением. Второй акт.\n«Народ нуждается в лидере», — сказал Джон.\nГлаза Ваантикалисакса вспыхнули гневом. «У них был лидер! Тридцать лет, и к чему это привело?! Я наблюдал, как Аякс… Я наблюдал за ним…»\nГлаза драконьего рыцаря дрогнули. Его когтистые руки сжали булаву и щит.\n«Я наблюдал, как клятва… провалилась».\n«Ваант… Ваант, Драконья Фаланга не провалилась. Вас предали. Это был Мандрагора! Один из ваших, ты не понимаешь? Ты такой же небезупречен, как и все мы.  Вы никогда не были «непогрешимыми». Это просто то, во что мы хотели верить. Вы просто народ — как и все мы». Драконий рыцарь посмотрел на окружающих, на трех крестьян, отчаянно ищущих кого-нибудь, кто бы им помог. Затем он снова посмотрел на своего друга.\n«Именно», — сказал Ваантикалисакс. Затем он повернулся и вышел из таверны.\nЧерты Драконьего Рыцаря\nГероям Драконьих рыцарей доступны следующие черты.\nЗнаковая черта: Змеиные Латы (Wyrmplate)\nВаша закалённая чешуя дарует вам неуязвимость к урону, равную вашему уровню, к одному из следующих типов урона: кислоте, холоду, порче, огню, молнии или яду.

Они знают и наслаждаются своей репутацией среди людей как тех, кто похищает детей забредающих слишком далеко в чащу. Людям дóлжно бояться деревьев.\nПриродная способность дромовых эльфов скрывать своё присутствие, называемая очарованием, отлично сочетается с их партизанским стилем боя, позволяя им быстро наносить удары из укрытия и снова сливаться с подлеском. Эти качества также делают относительно немногих дромовых эльфов, живущих в городах, прирождёнными мастерами городских боёв.\nО Дромовых эльфах\n«Мне страшно, — сказала Венна. — Нам стоит вернуться». Лес казался будто бы надвигающимся на них.\n«Мы не вернемся, — сказал Джереми. Обычно такое заявление положило бы конец дискуссии, но они были одни и далеко от дома.\n«А что, если мы ходим кругами?»\n«Тогда будем ходить кругами! — сказал Дэйд откуда-то впереди. — Пока не найдем эльфов». «Эльфы нашли вас!» — раздался чистый, ясный голос. Дети замерли. Они осмотрели лес, но не увидели никаких следов говорящего.\nЗатем, всего в нескольких метрах от них полдюжины фигур вынырнуло с заднего плана, словно деревья, кусты и трава были нарисованы на них, чтобы идеально вписаться в дром. Они были одеты в легкие доспехи, покрытые листьями, мхом и лианами, и вооружены до зубов. Мелиора ахнула. Кредан нахмурился, а Венна заставила ее замолчать. Дейд был сопровожден обратно к ним еще двумя дромовыми эльфами, с луком в руке.\nДети сгрудились вместе, рука Кредана лежала на символе Святого Грифона на его шее, а рука Джереми — на рукояти его меча.\nЭльфы были высокими, выше взрослого человека, но казалось, что они всегда приседают, как только останавливаются. Их глаза были настораживающими, широко поставленными и огромными. Но именно их уши, длинные, высокие, закрученные и с большими ложками для улавливания всех звуков, выдавали в них эльфов дрома.\n«Правда, большинство терран сожалеют об этом опыте». Голос, который они слышали, снова раздался — сверху. Дети посмотрели вверх и увидели дромового эльфа с длинными, мохнатыми, извивающимися ушами и орехово-коричневой кожей, улыбающегося им. Он был одет в яркий наряд. Дети наблюдали, как эльф легко прыгал с ветки на ветку, пока наконец эффектно не приземлился на лесную почву перед ними.\n«»Консорт!» — сказал эльф перед ними, на Иллирическом, вставая с корточек и кланяясь. «Мы следили за ними с тех пор, как они вошли в лес».\nМелиора, которая поняла слова, прошептала остальным: «Они назвали его «консорт»!\nЛлиандер улыбнулся, глядя то на Мелиору, то на эльфа, который только что обратился к ним, с выражением лица «Видите? Я же вам говорил!». Высокий, удалой эльф поклонился детям. «Я Ллиандер, Удар Молнии, супруг королевы Имирр». Он указал на эльфа, который говорил. «Это мой двоюродный брат, Ритилтин».\n«Откуда вы узнали, что мы здесь?» — спросил Джереми. Дэйд стоял прямо за ним, с наложенной на тетиву стрелой. Названный Ритилтином протянул руку, пока Дэйд был повернут, глядя на супруга королевы, и ловко снял стрелу с лука молодого человека.\n«Ничто не происходит в дроме без нашего ведома», — сказал эльф. Дейд резко повернулся к нему и натянул еще одну стрелу. «И одобрения», — добавил Ритилтин, сжимая кулак и ломая стрелу в нем. «Вы пришли с подарком для нашей королевы — Кодексом Дриадалис».\nЛлиандер кивнул на тяжелый свиток, который несла Мелиора. «Мой двоюродный брат Ритилтин был послан, чтобы схватить тебя и сопроводить в Двор Орхидей. Но я — консорт королевы и имею собственное мнение по этому\nвопросу».\nЭльф улыбнулся детям. «Но не бойтесь», — сказал он. Его Васлорский был\nбезупречен, а голос — мелодичен. «Вы в безопасности… сейчас». Пауза перед словом «сейчас» говорила о многом.\n«Ты… мальчик или девочка?» — спросила Венна.\nЛлиандер весело улыбнулся. «Я — песня! Во мне есть и мелодии, и гармонии», — ответил он. Венна улыбнулась.\nРитилтин закатил глаза. Ллиандер заметил это и подмигнул ему.\n«Мода меняется. Мой кузен здесь носит новые веяния». Они указали на одежду и мужской вид другого лесного эльфа. «Я? Я старомоден». Они указали на свою одежду и внешний вид. «Изящество никогда не выходит из моды».\nЛлиандер повернулся к Ритилину и остальным лесным эльфам.\n«Их подарок, по-моему, предназначен лорду Слезе. Я их провожу». Затем, внезапно приняв властный тон, он добавил: «Вы можете идти».\nНесмотря на свое прежнее скептическое отношение к супругу королевы, Ритилтин выпрямился и поклонился. Все эльфы одновременно повернулись и устремились в дром. Сделав всего несколько шагов, они слились с деревьями и подлеском.\n«Как они это сделали?» — спросила Мелиора, поворачиваясь к своему благодетелю.\n«Хм? Что сделали?» — спросил Ллиандер, глядя вслед эльфам и гадая, что имела в виду Мелиора.\n«Просто… так исчезли!»\nЛлиандер посмотрел на других детей со смесью удивления и раздражения. «Разве дети терран не играют в прятки?»\n«Ну…» Джереми посмотрел на Дэйда, который не помог ему. «Мы играем, но…»\nЛлиандер сделал театральный, пренебрежительный жест рукой. «Ну вот, это одно и то же. Но для нашего народа это игра, в которой мы упражняемся всю жизнь! Мы были бы плохими защитниками дрома, если бы не могли скрыться в нем».\n«Но это было…» Мелиора была разочарована кажущимся уклонением эльфа.\n«Это была магия!»\n«Магия, говоришь? Ну, — задумчиво произнес Ллиандер, — говорят, что терране — это и часть целого, и отдельное целое. Это ваше благословение и проклятие, как видится мне. Может быть, когда-нибудь вы сможете мне это объяснить!» Глаза эльфа заблестели, увидев разочарование Мелиоры. Ллиандер повернулся и пошел прочь. « Идем! — позвал он. Дети побежали, чтобы догнать его.\n«Куда мы идем?» — спросила Венна.\n«Я пользуюсь благосклонностью лорда Слезы, — сказал Ллиандер. — Мы старые друзья. Со мной в качестве вашего проводника он будет хорошо к вам относиться — скорее всего, окажет вам милость! Вас ждет великое сокровище». Они улыбнулись.\nЭльф внезапно остановился и повернулся к ним, серьезный, но доброжелательный. Он указал по очереди на каждого из детей.\n«Я научу вас правильному этикету, но запомните: лорд Слеза будет испытывать нас. Некоторые испытания будут для вас, а некоторые — для меня. Высшие эльфы и дромовые эльфы — лишь дальние родственники. Вы услышите много вежливого, много лестного, но все это — лишь еще один вид очарования. Оно скрывает глубокие напряженности, недавно усугубленные договором с Аяксом».\nДети кивнули. Эльф, удовлетворенный, зашагал вперед, и они последовали за ним. Джереми повернулся к Дэйду. «Мне кажется, словно мы во сне», — прошептал он. «Вы и есть во сне!» — воскликнул их сопровождающий. «Дром — это сон, это дремота! С небольшой долей везения, та от которой вы скоро сможете безопасно пробудиться».\nЧерты Дромовых Эльфов\nГероям дромовых эльфов доступны следующие черты.\nЗнаковая черта: Чары Дромовых Эльфов (Wode Elf Glamor)\nВы можете магически менять свой внешний вид, чтобы лучше сливаться с окружением.

Но на этом чуждом мире озёра — это моря ртути, птицы сверкают крыльями из стекла, натянутого тончайшей паутиной, а лепестки цветов — радужный металл, гибкий и хрупкий, как земная роза.\nСознания мемонеков строго упорядочены. Их Разум — их большая гордость. Но при спуске на низшие планы, включая многообразие вроде Ордена, где закон и хаос смешиваются, их охватывает болезнь — неконтролируемое ощущение, называемое эмоцией.\nО Мемонеках\n«Ты не хочешь рассказать мне, что только что произошло?» — спросил сэр Джон. Граф Ревайл избегал его взгляда, затем повернулся и затопал по окровавленному полю битвы. «Я в порядке!» — крикнул Ревайл, несмотря на все доказательства обратного.\n«Я знаю, что я видел», — сказал Джон, следуя за своим другом. «Ты впал в жажду крови. И это не в первый раз. Послушай!» — крикнул Джон, что было для него несвойственно, пытаясь привлечь внимание графа. «Ты просил меня о помощи, помнишь? Ты хочешь вернуться домой», — Джон указал на небо, «… и ты просил о помощи, а я сказал — ты помнишь? — я сказал: «Есть ли что-нибудь еще, о чем нам следует знать?»\n«Я имел в виду: «Есть ли кто-то, кто преследует тебя, о ком нам нужно знать ?» Но начинает казаться, что с тобой что-то не так. О чем ты знал и решил не говорить мне».\nВитъярану, Граф АЛАВ Ревайл, шагал взад-вперед, его плащ\nразвевался. Джон продолжил.\n«Слушай, нравится тебе это или нет, нравится мне это или нет, я руководитель этой миссии. Либо ты рассказываешь мне, что происходит, либо у меня не будет выбора. Я буду вынужден сделать вывод, что ты представляешь опасность для команды, и уволить тебя».\nРевайл остановился и повернулся, чтобы посмотреть на остальных членов группы, которые приходили в себя\nпосле полученных ранений. Белая фарфоровая грудь мемонека поднималась и опускалась, пока он пытался успокоиться. Его керамическая кожа выглядела прочной, как броня, но Джон знал, что она хрупкая и ломкая.\nГраф Ревайл глубоко вздохнул. «Мы называем это веллопарата», — сказал он. «На вашем языке это будет… мировая болезнь. Или болезнь мира? Это то, что происходит… с моим народом… когда они приходят в ваш мир. Это болезнь… чувств. Эмоций».\n«Ты сходишь с ума?» — тихо спросил Джон. Он хотел дать графу возможность ответить наедине. Мемонек грустно улыбнулся. «Иногда так и кажется. Сегодня утром я целый час смотрел на насекомое, которое приземлилось на мой палец. Кузнечик, как назвал его дварф. Я подумал, что никогда не видел ничего столь совершенного и прекрасного. Это было благоговение. Самое сильное, что я когда-либо испытывал. В сегодняшней битве — гнев. Столь же сильный.\nЯ думал, что смогу противостоять этому. Когда я прибыл сюда и не почувствовал никакой разницы, я подумал, что, возможно, болезнь миров — это лишь миф. Но это медленный процесс, эта болезнь. Эти коварные эмоции».\n«Там, откуда ты родом, нет эмоций?»\nГраф Ревайл покачал головой. «Не таких. Мы, жители Аксиомы, — существа разума.  Это наше искусство, наша гордость. Иногда мне кажется, что это даже наша религия. У нас есть эмоции: радость, печаль, удивление, горе. Но они…  это своего рода мода.  Они не случаются с нами, мы позволяем себе их проявлять, из приличия. Здесь… всё — смесь порядка и хаоса. Даже во мне. Во мне». Ревайл положил руку на грудь.\n«В сегодняшней битве. Этот гнев был направлен не на боевых псов Аякса. Он был направлен на меня самого».\n«На себя? Почему? Что ты…?»\n«Джон», — сказал мемонек, и теперь настала его очередь шептать. «Я боялся. Боялся… быть раненым, подвести тебя, подвести своих друзей. Умереть. И из этого страха родился… огромный гнев. На самого себя. Гнев за то, что я был так слаб, так… бесполезен. Гнев столь… сильный, столь мощный… что я забыл, кто я такой».\nДжон усмехнулся. «Это просто…» Он широко улыбнулся. «Это просто нормально. Мы все так чувствуем».\n«Что? Нет, ты не понимаешь…»\n«О, я не понимаю, ладно, дай угадаю. Было такое ощущение, что ты сейчас описаешься».\n«Да!!»\n«Да, с каждым из нас такое бывает».\n«Даже с тобой?».\nСэр Джон пожал плечами. «Ты шутишь? Конечно. Но это не помогает. У тебя все равно\nесть работа, которую нужно выполнить. На самом деле, я бы сказал, что это и есть работа. Любой может научиться клинку».\nОн положил руку на рукоять своего меча.\n«В этом нет ничего особенного. Суть в том, чтобы научиться справляться со страхом. В этом работа. Это то, что отличает профессионалов от любителей».\nГраф Ревайл ничего не сказал, только задумался.\n«Чувствуешь себя лучше?»\nРевайл кивнул. «Я всегда прихожу в себя впоследствии. Но эти вспышки происходят без предупреждения. Как гром среди ясного неба».\n«Хм. Да. Ну, это объясняет, что произошло, когда ты встретил Эмберс».\nГрафу Ревайлу не нравилось, когда ему напоминали об этом. Он посмотрел на\nнебо и покачал головой. «Я выставил себя дураком».\n«Не будь к себе так строг. Если ты пытаешься соблазнить нашу магиню пустоты, то ты неплохо начал. Ей триста лет. Я\nзнаю ее с пятнадцати лет. Не думаю, что когда-либо видела, чтобы она краснела.\nВ любом случае, теперь, когда я знаю, что происходит, теперь, когда я знаю, что ты по сути гигантский подросток с гиперактивными железами, я могу немного расслабиться.»\nЭмберс подошла и вручила Джону небольшой тяжелый предмет. Она посмотрела на двух мужчин, а затем ушла.\n«Она была права», — сказал Джон, глядя на звездное ядро иридосса. «Они не знали, что это такое, но они определенно не хотели, чтобы мы это получили.\n«Вот», — сказал Джон, передавая двигатель графу Ревилу. «Думаю, ты свободен».\nРевайл посмотрел на изысканную клетку из латуни и стекла, в которой кружилось синее звездное небо. «Пожалуй, да», — сказал он. Он посмотрел на сэра Джона. «Я не ожидал, что наша дружба будет такой короткой».\nДжон улыбнулся и, возможно, немного покраснел. «Ну, — сказал он, глядя на\nостальных членов экипажа, — быть одним из моих друзей в наши дни — опасная профессия».\nГраф стал еще серьезнее. «Мне повезло встретить такого человека, как ты,\nв этом мире».\nДжон пожал плечами. «Единственный мир, который я когда-либо знал».\nГраф Ревайл поднял звездное ядро. «У меня есть обязанности, которые я должен выполнять. Я вернусь домой, и это место останется только воспоминанием». Граф был открыто опечален. «И ты можешь забыть о чужаке, которого ты спас, и его корабле из стекла и стали».\n«О, я в этом сомневаюсь», — сказал Джон. «Но я скажу тебе вот что. Я никогда больше не буду смотреть на звезды так же, как раньше».\nДжон протянул руку. Ревайл пожал ее, а затем удержал. «Если в этом мире богов и магии есть много таких, как ты, — сказал благородный мемонекский звездный капитан, — то твоя победа над злом гарантирована».\n«Я не знаю, много ли их, — сказал Джон, вырывая руку. Он посмотрел на дварфа, эльфа и хакаана. — Но их может быть достаточно».\nЧерты Мемонеков\nГероям-мемонекам доступны следующие черты.\nЗнаковая черта: Лёгкое Падение (Fall Lightly)\nВаше кремниевое тело мало по плотности.

Традиционные хакааны иногда называют видение гибели “вирдкен”.\nЧерты Хакаана\nГероям Хакаанам доступны следующие черты.\nЗнаковая черта: Большой! (Big!)\nВаш рост отражает гигантское наследие предков. Ваш размер 1L.\nПриобретаемые черты Хакаана\nУ вас есть 3 очка происхождения, которые можно потратить на следующие черты. (Быстрый выбор:_ Doomsight, Forceful)\nВсё как Перо, All Is a Feather (1 Point)\nВы исключительно сильны. Вы получаете преимущество на проверки, сделанные для подъёма и перемещения тяжёлых предметов.\nВидение гибели, Doomsight (2 Points)\nРаботая с вашим Режиссёром, вы можете заранее определить встречу, в которой вы умрёте. Когда эта встреча начинается, вы становитесь обречены. Пока вы обречены, вы автоматически получаете результат 3-го уровня на проверки и броски способностей, и вы не умираете, независимо от того, насколько низка ваша Выносливость. В конце встречи вы умираете немедленно и не можете быть возвращены к жизни никакими средствами.\nЕсли вы не предопределили свою встречу со смертью, вы можете выбрать стать обречёнными, когда вы умираете, с одобрения Режиссёра (действие не требуется). Это следует использовать только в случаях, когда вы умираете в результате достойного героизма, например, при последнем сопротивлении боссу или спасении граждан, или когда последствия ваших действий настигли вас — а не потому, что вы играете однократное приключение и вам нечего терять.\nКроме того, когда ваша Выносливость достигает отрицательного значения вашего показателя усталости и вы не обречены, вы обращаетесь в каменные обломки вместо того, чтобы умереть. Вы не осознаёте окружение в этом состоянии и не можете восстановить Выносливость или отменить этот эффект. Через 12 часов вы восстанавливаете Выносливость, равную вашему значению Восстановления.\nСила Движения, Forceful (1 Point)\nКаждый раз, когда вы принудительно перемещаете существо или предмет, дистанция принудительного перемещения получает бонус +1.\nВеликая Стойкость, Great Fortitude (2 Points)\nВаше крепкое телосложение не позволяет вам терять силы. Вы не можете быть ослаблены.\nСтоять на Своём, Stand Tough (1 Point)\nВаше тело создано, чтобы выдерживать удары врагов. Ваш показатель Силы считается на 1 выше при сопротивлении Мощностям (potencies), и вы получаете преимущество на проверки Силы при сопротивлении эффектам окружающей среды или чертам или способностям существ."},"Происхождение-(Ancestries)/Человек-(Human)":{"slug":"Происхождение-(Ancestries)/Человек-(Human)","filePath":"Происхождение (Ancestries)/Человек (Human).md","title":"Человек (Human)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"«Люди», — сказал дварф со смесью раздражения и благоговения. «Их единственная добродетель, кажется, заключается в вере в невозможные вещи».\n«Люди принадлежат миру так, как другие говорящие народы не принадлежат. Вы можете чувствовать присутствие магии — этот… маслянистый запах в воздухе, как его описывают.   И присутствие неумирающих заставляет волосы на затылке встать дыбом. Или почему, по-вашему, кладбища так на вас действуют? Чем бы ни была магия, ее влияние на вас слабо. Что бы ни двигало неумирающими,  ваша природа восстает против этого.\nНикто не знает, почему так происходит. У нас, эльфов, нет таких чувств. Как и у элементалей или канин… Дварфов и орков, как вы их называете. Что же отличает людей?\nЯ историк, а не врач. Не могу сказать. Возможно, кто-то из вас однажды узнает и расскажет нам всем причину».\nО Людях\nИтак, мы подошли к концу вашего первого семестра курса «Культура человечества». Надеюсь увидеть вас в следующем году на курсе «Целийская империя», и хотя сейчас в это трудно поверить, я часто вижу имена бывших студентов в наших учебниках спустя годы. Возможно, среди них будут и некоторые из вас.\nТеперь я отвечу на вопрос, который мне задают чаще всего и который я оставляю на последний день занятий. Что я думаю о людях?\nЯ высший эльф, как вы это называете на своем языке. Дитя солнечных Небожителей. И я преподаю\nэтот курс, в основном молодым людям, с тех пор, как келийские императоры основали этот город. Первый канцлер предложил мне присоединиться к профессорско-преподавательскому составу. Я видел, как поколения вашего народа проходили через эту аудиторию, и уже одно это дает мне право ответить на этот вопрос.\nЧто я думаю о людях? Ну, я вам скажу.\nЯ был здесь, преподавая этот предмет во время пожара Просвещения 373 года. Пожар сравнял этот город с землей. Можете себе это представить? Можете себе представить жару, смерть, разрушение, которые вызывает такое событие? Через шесть месяцев после Великого пожара ваши предки восстановили… все. Я видел много чудес в своей жизни. Наблюдение за этим подвигом, пожалуй, было главным из них.\nЛичи почти всегда являются людьми. Вы знали об этом? Я думаю, я знаю почему. Ваша жизнь так коротка — почти сразу после рождения вы начинаете думать о смерти и отказываетесь сдаваться.\nЭтот отказ сдаваться смерти… до смерти… это то, что движет вами, как мне кажется. Побуждает вас оставить мир лучше, чем вы его нашли. Заставляет разрушенных людей возродить великий город.\nМы изучали историю человечества в этой комнате. Вам кажется, что ваши великие предки были, возможно, сделаны из лучшего сырья, чем вы? Не думайте так. Я знал их, и я знаю вас, и ваше будущее значительнее. Иногда я думаю, что каждое поколение людей лучше предыдущего — более смелое, более щедрое. Более скорое на прощение.\nСегодня имя Аякса на устах у всех, но я видел много великого зла, возникающего в мире. Я преподавал в этой аудитории, когда фараон Хорсекеф, отчаявшись и теряя свою власть, открыл Великий Тет и выпил хранящееся там время, став Ультраличем. Он был побежден и теперь правит Некрополисскими Руинами в Бездонной Пустоши.\nЯ был жив, хотя еще не был профессором, когда Ктрион Уронизир попыталась свести таймскейп к одной единственной вселенной, уничтожив реальность, как мы ее знаем. Она была побеждена, и мы видим ее клетку каждый день.\nКаждое из этих великих зол было побеждено коалицией. Армиями и героями многих народов. И все они — все они — были возглавлены… людьми. Это факт. Это история. Вы можете проверить.\nЕсть ли какая-то редкая черта, которая делает вас уникально подходящими для того, чтобы возглавить разные народы, объединить их для достижения великих целей? Я думаю… должно быть.\nЭти великие люди, ваши предки, не обращали внимания на различия. Они не оценивали разные народы и не делили их на основе произвольных черт, считавшихся достоинствами и недостатками. Так поступает Аякс. Нет, эти люди сосредоточивались на будущем. На создании лучшего мира… для всех нас. Мира, до которого многие из них знали, что не доживут. Это жертва… которую я с трудом могу себе представить.\nЛюди, которые противостоят Аяксу и тиранам, подобным ему, будут такими же, как вы — обычными людьми. Священники, ученые, купцы и фермеры. Возможно, даже учителя.\nЧтобы остановить Аякса, вам придется стать кем-то другим. Вы должны стать героями. Проводниками святых, полководцами великих армий. Цензорами и тенями. Сейчас это может показаться маловероятным, но будущее умеет удивлять нас.\nНекоторые из ваших имен я увижу написанными в будущих учебниках.\nНо некоторые из ваших имен я увижу написанными на звездах.\nЧерты Человека\nГероям Людям доступны следующие черты.\nЗнаковая черта: Обнаружение Сверхъестественного (Detect the Supernatural)\nВ качестве манёвра вы можете открыть своё восприятие, чтобы обнаружить сверхъестественные существа и явления. До конца вашего следующего хода вы знаете местоположение любого сверхъестественного предмета или любого неживого (undead), конструкта или существа из другого мира в пределах 5 клеток, даже если у вас нет линии воздействия на этот предмет или существо. Вы знаете, обнаруживаете ли вы предмет или существо, и знаете природу любого обнаруженного существа.\nПриобретаемые черты Человека\nУ вас есть 3 очка происхождения, которые можно потратить на следующие черты. (Быстрый выбор: Perseverance, Staying Power)\nНе Поддаюсь, Can’t Take Hold (1 Point)\nВаша связь с природным миром позволяет сопротивляться определённым сверхъестественным эффектам. Вы игнорируете труднопроходимую местность, временно созданную магией или психическими способностями. Кроме того, когда вас принудительно перемещает магическая или психическая способность, вы можете уменьшить дистанцию принудительного перемещения на 1.\nРешимость, Determination (2 Points)\nВыносливость к боли и стрессу позволяет преодолевать трудные ситуации. Если вы испуганы, замедлены или ослаблены, вы можете использовать манёвр, чтобы немедленно снять одно из этих состояний.\nНастойчивость, Perseverance (1 Point)\nСдаваться — это для других. Вы получаете преимущество на проверки, сделанные с использованием Навыка Стойкость (Endurance). Кроме того, когда вы замедлены, ваша скорость уменьшается до 3 вместо 2.\nСопротивление Противоестественному, Resist the Unnatural (1 очко)\nВаша врождённая стойкость защищает от травм, выходящих за рамки обычного. Каждый раз, когда вы получаете урон, который не имеет типа, вы можете использовать реакцию, чтобы получить половину урона.\nStaying Power (2 Points)\nВаша человеческая физиология позволяет дольше сражаться, бегать и не спать. Вы увеличиваете количество Восстановлений на 2."}}
